🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project implements a K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to help a retail store better understand its customer base and personalize marketing strategies accordingly.

📌 Objective
To cluster customers into distinct groups using unsupervised learning based on features such as Annual Income and Spending Score, providing meaningful insights into customer behavior.

📊 Dataset
  *Source: Kaggle – Customer Segmentation Tutorial Dataset
  *Fields Used:
  *Gender
  *Age
  *Annual Income (k$)
  *Spending Score (1-100)

🛠️ Project Steps
  *Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting data for analysis.
  *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and relationships.
  *Feature Selection & Scaling: Preparing features for clustering.
  *Applying K-Means Algorithm: Grouping customers into clusters.
  *Cluster Visualization: Using 2D and 3D plots to display customer groups.

📈 Results
The final output segments customers into clusters such as High Income, Low Spending, Low Income, High Spending, etc., which can be used for:
  *Personalized marketing
  *Targeted offers
  *Better customer relationship management

🚀 Future Scope
  *Apply other clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
  *Use more features like frequency of purchases or product categories
  *Build a dashboard to visualize customer clusters in real time
